        <ul>
            <li>(if) keyword is known as a Conditional statement, also known as testing</li>
            <li>The only reason an (if) condition will run if the value is true</li>

            <li>complex conditions can be created using the logical operator:</li>

        <h3>Repeat Statement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>loops are used to repeat statements. Each repition is called an iteration.</li>
            <li>While loop repeats statements while a certain condition is true.</li>
            <li>For Loop gives the abulity to manage what happens just before the loop starts and after each loop iteration has run.</li>
            <li>variable associated with the loop condition is called a loop counter which is often seen as i</li>
            <li>While loop will run if the condition is true if not, it will not run and or it will not run at all</li>
            <li>For loop has three things in the parenthese: Initialization , Condition , final expressions</li>
            <li>Initialization: only happens once, when the code first kicks off. It's often used to set the initial value of the 
                variable associated to the loop condition
            </li>
            <li>condition: is evaluated once before the loop runs each time. if it's true, the code runs. if not, the code doesn't run</li>
            <li>Final Expression: is evaluated after the loop runs each time. It's often used to update the value of the variable associated
                with the loop condition, as we saw in the previous example.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>which to use?</h3>
        <p>
            For loops are greate because they include the notion of counting by default, avoiding the problem of infinite loops. 
            However, it means you have to know how many times you want the loop to run as soon as you write your code.
            
            my own understanding is basically when using for loop you need to make sure you know how many times you're going to be
            looping, if not you'll go into an inifite loop.

            While loops is more where you don't need to know how many times you need to loop. As long as your value is false you will not
            get into a infinite loop.
