        <h3>Understanding Object Oriented programming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OOP is uses objects to contain both data and behavior to create programs</li>
            <li>"class" keyword it can only contain methods. </li>
            <li>"contructor" method is called during object creation. it helps initialize the object</li>
            <li>"this" keyword represents the object on which the method was called on</li>
            <li>objects are created from a class with the "new" operator</li>
            <li>
                OOP is based on prototypes. prototypes are used to share properties 
                and delegate behavior between objects.
            </li>
            <li>
            there are ways to create and link Js objects through prototypes. one is to use the
            object.create() method.
            </li>
        </ul>
