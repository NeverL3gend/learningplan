    <h3>Javascript notes</h3>
    <section>
        <h3> 3, 2, 1... Code!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>String value is surrounded by single and double quotes</li>
            <li>Arithmetic operations between numbers are provied by the + (add), - (subtracted),  * (multiplication),  / (division)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> Play with variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>to declare a variable you use let and const. declaring a vairiable using let allows the vaule to change where as const doesn't</li>
            <li>to give a value to a variable you use the assignment operator =. += increases the value while ++ increments </li>
            <li> (`) back tick used in a string are called template literals</li>
            <li>Type conversions happens during evaluation or when being used as Number() or String()</li>
            <li>Prompt() and Alert() deal with information input and display under the form of dialog box</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Variable scope</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is visible and usable</li>
                <li>variables declared with let or const are blocked scope: their visibility is limited to the block where they are declared.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Expressions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An expression is a piece of code that produces a value.</li>
                <li>An expression is created by combining variables, values and operators.</li>
                <li>Calculating an expression value is called an evaluation</li>
                <li>Template Literals are often used to create strings containing the values of some variables. It is also I dentified as ${expression} syntax</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Type Conversions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> expression evaluation can result in type conversions, these are called implicit conversions</li>
                <li>Javascript is extremely tolerant in terms of typ conversion. However, sometimes conversion isnt possible. If a value failes to convert into a number 
                    youll get a NaN (not a number)
                </li>
                <li> Sometimes youll convert the value to another type, this is called explicit conversion. Javascript has the Number() and string() 
                    commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a number or a string.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>User interactions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>once you start using variables you can write programs that exchange information with the user</li>
                <li> When entering in the string in the variable name, Js command alert() then triggered the display of the second box.</li>
            </ul>
