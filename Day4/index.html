    <ul>
        <li>an array represents a list of elements. An array is an object that has special properties, 
            like "length" to access its size
        </li>
        <li>Each value stored in an array associated with a number is called an index</li>
        <li>you can access a particular element by passing its index within square brackets []</li>
        <li>you can iterate over an array by using for loop, forEach() method and newer loop for-of</li>
        <li>Push() method adds an element at the end of the array.</li>
        <li>unshift() method addss it at the beginning</li>
        <li>Pop() method and slice() method removes elements from the array</li>
    </ul>
