    <h3>Store Data in arrays</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>an array represents a list of elements. An array is an object that has special properties, 
            like "length" to access its size
        </li>
        <li>Each value stored in an array associated with a number is called an index</li>
        <li>you can access a particular element by passing its index within square brackets []</li>
        <li>you can iterate over an array by using for loop, forEach() method and newer loop for-of</li>
        <li>Push() method adds an element at the end of the array.</li>
        <li>unshift() method addss it at the beginning</li>
        <li>Pop() method and slice() method removes elements from the array</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adding an element to an array</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>push() adds an element at the end of the array</li>
        <li>unshift() adds an element at the beginning of the array</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Removing an element from an array</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>pop() method removes the last array element</li>
        <li>splice() method has two parameters: first one is the index from which to begin removing, and second 
            one is the number of elements to remove.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>String Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>length property returns the number of characters of the string</li>
        <li>Immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created</li>
        <li>toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() methods returns a new converted string to lower and upper case</li>
        <li>string valuees may be compared using the === which is case sensitve</li>
        <li>you can iterate over as string by doing for loop or for-of</li>
        <li>array.from() method can be used to turn a string into an array that can be letter by letter with the 
            forEach() method
        </li>
        <li>searching for values inside a string is possible with the indexOf(), startsWith() and endsWith()</li>
        <li>split() method breaks a string into subparts delimited by a separator</li>
        <li> to access each character of a string you'll need to use a for loop.</li>
    </ul>
